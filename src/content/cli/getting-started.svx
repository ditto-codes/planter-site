**What is a Planter?**

A planter is a repo that you have added to your list that you can then use `create` to quickly start a new project from with no git history. You can also use `create` with a remote repo directly without referencing an existing planter. 

Think of a planter as an easily accessible bookmark to a repo. You can use that bookmark to create a brand new project from that repo with no git history.
