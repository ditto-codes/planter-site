## Planter

Planter is a CLI created to help you maintain and use project starters quickly and easily. Stop wasting time setting up projects and start new ones with planters!

### What is a Planter?

A planter is a repo that you have added to your list that you can then use `create` to quickly start a new project from with no git history. You can also use `create` with a remote repo directly without referencing an existing planter. 

Think of a planter as an easily accessible bookmark to a repo. You can use that bookmark to create a brand new project from that repo with no git history. 

## Getting Started

npm i -g @planter/cli

planter create my-planter my-project
