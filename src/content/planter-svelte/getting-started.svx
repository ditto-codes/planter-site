# Getting Started

Planter Svelte is a web project starter that uses [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and comes with starter styles built out with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) as well as a few simple components to serve as both examples and for use in your project.


Get started by running these two commands to install dependencies and startup the local dev server:
```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Make sure to set up your editor for Svelte language support. We recommend the [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode) extension, but there's also [support for other editors](https://sveltesociety.dev/tools/#editor-support) (Submlime, Vim, WebStorm).


## Project Structure
There are two basic concepts of SvelteKit:
- Each page of your app is a Svelte component
- You create pages by adding files to the src/routes directory of your project.

### `/src`
The home for all your project code.

### `/static`
Static assets, such as images or external scripts.

### `/src/routes`
Create pages by adding files to the `src/routes` directory of your project. Read more about [routing](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing) in SvelteKit. 
Note: at the root of `src/routes`, there's a file named `__layout.svelte`; Planter Svelte uses this file to apply global styles to all pages. Read more about [layouts](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/layouts) in SvelteKit.

### `/src/components`
A place to house your components. This directory includes a few simple components to get you started.

### `/src/styles`
Global stylesheets, Sass variables, mixins, and functions. 

### `/src/routes/demo` & `/src/components/demo`
The `src/routes/demo` page showcases how SvelteKit can work, while also documenting the components and default styles we've included. All demo content is contained within `src/routes/demo` and `src/components/demo` and can be freely deleted.
